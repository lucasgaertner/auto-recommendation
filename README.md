Modern recommender problems involve complex objects, often described in textual form. I visualized a text-based recommendation engine that utilizes minimum edit distance, dynamic programming and word probabilities. The text corpus is a history play called Henry V document written from shakespeare in near 1599. My approach was to obtain a text-to-vector mapping visualization. The basic Idea why I used dynamic programming is for optimization over plain recursion for repeating following repeating tasks
